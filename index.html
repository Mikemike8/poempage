    <h1>Leisure</h1>

    <h2>By W. H. Davies</h2>

    <address>  <p style=" font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"> What is this life if, full of care,
        We have no time to stand and stare 
        
        No time to stand beneath the boughs,
        And stare as long as sheep and cows 
        
        No time to see, when woods we pass,
        Where squirrels hide their nuts in grass 
        
        No time to see, in broad daylight,
        Streams full of stars, like skies at night 
        
        No time to turn at Beauty's glance,
        And watch her feet, how they can dance 
        
        No time to wait till her mouth can
        Enrich that smile her eyes began 
        
        A poor life this if, full of care,
        We have no time to stand and stare
        .
        </p>
        </address>
